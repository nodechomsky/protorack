A modular system for prototyping tools

The goal of this project is to produce a convergent set of standardized designs for intermodular featuring, fixturing, and dimensioning standard tools used in the process of developing hardware prototypes, specifically in the realm of electronic engineering and it's unique needs.


Standards/Objectives/Goals
 -Intermodularity within the system to allow creative repurposing and open thought-space for the engineer

 -Interoperability with existing tools with an emphasis on common dimensioning standards found in other tools

 -Open Source and collaborative development of shared standards to allow ideas to be more easily synthesized and shared between collaborators
